## atom-nyancat

Because every serious text editor needs a nyancat plugin to prove its worth.

Inspired by: Emacs Nyan Cat mode ([https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode](https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode))

### Usage

Install plugin. Use.  Visit: [https://atom.io/packages/nyancat](https://atom.io/packages/nyancat)

### Warnings

This hasn't been thoroughly tested, beacuse thoroughly testing is not in the spirit of nyancat.

(Also this is my first Atom package so if I break everything in your editor, plz just uninstall nyancat.)
